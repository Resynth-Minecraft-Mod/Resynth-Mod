/**
 * A ReferenceKey - RKey for short, references one or more specific
 * keys on the keyboard. The RKey object instance can then be queried
 * to check if the key/keys referenced are pressed or not. Listener
 * Callbacks are not a part of this class.
 *
 * <p/>RKeys operate in one of two different {@link Mode modes},
 * either the default IF_ANY: checking if any referenced key is pressed,
 * and IF_ALL: checking if all referenced keys are pressed.
 *
 * <p/>Each key is mapped to a specific positive integer which is
 * what is passed to the RKey constructor to define key refences.
 *
 * The list of what key is mapped to what integer number was taken
 * from Minecrafts {@link net.minecraft.client.util.InputMappings}
 * classes, and copied to a comment at the end of this class file.
 *
 * <p/>Use {@link #query()} to query the pressed status of referenced
 * key/keys in the RKey object. With Singled RKeys the {@code query()}
 * method will then either return the boolean {@code true} if the key
 * is pressed, or {@code false} if the key is not pressed.
 *
 * <p/>Chained RKeys referencing more than one key are more complicated.
 * If they are in the Mode {@link Mode#ANY}, calling {@code query()}
 * will return {@code true} if any referenced key is pressed and {@code
 * false} otherwise. If they are in the Mode {@link Mode#ALL},
 * calling {@code query()}  will return {@code false} unless every
 * referenced key is pressed.
 *
 * <p/>This class was written after the Minecraft code Resynth used
 * to check key presses was changed and obfuscated in 1.16. The
 * difficulty caused by that left me wanting a better system,
 * specifically one that won't change and is readable & understandable.
 * This class, sadly, still relys on the same old Minecraft code under
 * the hood, improving on usability and consistancy, but still prone
 * to always changing always breaking Minecraft source code.
 *
 * @see CommonRKeys CommonRKeys for a list of the most common keyboard
 * keys, each with their own already initialized RKey ready to use.
